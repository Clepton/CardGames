<h1> One Hand game </h1>

<h2>The goal of the projet is to reproduce a “Réussite” game</h2>

<p>The rules are the
following:

The game simply needs a complete shuFled 52-cards deck. Start by drawing a “hand” (4
cards) from the deck.
Now take a look at this “hand”:

- If the first and last cards have the same number, the four cards are all discarded,
and you score 5 points.

- If the first and last cards have the same suit (hearts ♥, diamonds ♦, clubs ♣ or
spades ♠), the two cards in the middle of your hand are discarded and you score
2 points.
  
- If those two conditions are not met, hide the last card behind the third one and
draw a new card from the deck to be the new first card of your hand. Keep drawing
cards if you cannot score points but you must always have 4 visible cards in your
hand and the previous ones hidden behind the fourth one.


The Joker: if you cannot discard cards (no matching suits or numbers between the first
and last visible cards of your hand) you can get rid of the two cards in the middle of your
hand. This is allowed only three times per game. The joker score zero points.</p>
